                <li>
                    <strong>1912</strong> - Born in Maida Vale</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1928</strong> - Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of Newton's laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1931</strong> - Enrolled at the University of Cambridge to study mathematics</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1934</strong> - Graduated from Cambridge and was elected to a fellowship at King’s College for his research in probability theory</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1936</strong> - Published the seminal paper “On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem,” which had profound significance for the emerging science of computing</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1938</strong> -  Completed his Ph.D. in mathematical logic at Princeton University under the guidance of Alonzo Church</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1939</strong> - gave the British and French details of the wiring of Enigma machine's rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma machine's messages, Turing and Knox developed a broader solution</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1942</strong> -  Devised a technique termed Turingery for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans' new Geheimschreiber (secret writer) machine</li>
            </ul><ul>
            <li><strong>1946</strong> - appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by King George VI for his wartime services, his work remained secret for many years</li>
        </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1947</strong> -  returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1948</strong> - tried out for the British Olympic team, but he was hampered by an injury</li>
            </ul><ul>
            <li><strong>1950</strong> -  Introduced the concept of the universal Turing machine, a theoretical model for computation</li>
        </ul><ul>
            <li><strong>1954</strong> - Tragically passed away on June 7 in Wilmslow, Cheshire, at the age of 41</li>
        </ul><ul>
            <li><strong>1956</strong> -  His influential paper “The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis” explored biological pattern formation</li>
        </ul><ul>
            <li><strong>1966</strong> - The Turing Award (often called the Nobel Prize of computing) was established in his honor</li>
        </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1983</strong> -  The Turing test was proposed as a measure of machine intelligence</li>

            <p>“These commemorations do much to add to an awareness not only of Turing’s extraordinary impact on our world today, but also of the appalling struggles he went through. We want to celebrate Turing as a Kingsman, as a mathematician. King’s will continue to share the life and the work of Alan Turing with immense pride.”</p>
